GPS Cookie Instructions
-----------------------

1. Format a 2GB – 16GB Micro SD card in Windows (MSDOS-FAT).  _You can do this on a Windows or MAC based computer._
2. Insert the SD card into the GPS Cookie slot.
3. With 2 fresh AAA batteries installed, turn on the GPS Cookie using the slider switch.
4. The **red** led should start blinking every second if the SD card is installed and formatted **correctly**.
5. Take the Cookie outdoors and wait a few minutes for the GPS receiver to lock on to the satellites.  The led will start flashing **green** to let you know it is **recording**.
6. Go for a drive, walk or bike ride and record the locations of everywhere you go.
7. When you return, you can view the recorded data as a text file or open it directly in Google Earth via the _'tools'_, _'GPS'_ menu.  Select the import (import from file) and load the data directly into Google Earth.
